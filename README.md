## 🧪 Sample `.txt` Output

```
[00:00] Speaker A ▶ Hello, I’m calling about the maintenance contract.
[00:04] Speaker B ▶ Sure, could you give me your case number?
```

In the web app, every utterance shows its `MM:SS - MM:SS` span; the
**Timestamps** toggle in the transcript view controls the display, the
*Copy transcript* button and the TXT download
(`GET /transcripts/{id}?format=txt&timestamps=true`).

Single-speaker recordings (podcasts, dictation, monologues) come back from
AssemblyAI as one long utterance, since utterances group consecutive words by
speaker. Those are split into ~30 second segments on sentence boundaries, so a
timestamp appears regularly rather than once at `00:00`.

## 🔔 Webhooks

MemoMind can POST a signed JSON event to an endpoint of your choice
(n8n, Make, Zapier, your own API) when:

- a user signs up — `user.registered`
- a transcription is requested — `transcription.requested`
  (plus `transcription.completed` / `transcription.failed`)

Set `WEBHOOK_URL` (or `WEBHOOK_SIGNUP_URL` / `WEBHOOK_TRANSCRIPTION_URL`) and
`WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your `.env`. Full payloads, headers and signature
verification: [WEBHOOKS.md](WEBHOOKS.md).

## 🚀 Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions including:
- Docker deployment
- VPS/Cloud hosting (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Platform services (Netlify, Vercel, Railway, Render)
- Production configuration
- Security best practices

## 📱 Mobile App (Coming Soon)

- [ ] iOS native app with Swift/SwiftUI
- [ ] In-app audio recording
- [ ] Offline mode support

## 🔒 User Registration

The app now supports **user registration**! When you first access the login page:

1. Click "Don't have an account? Create one"
2. Enter a username and password (email is optional)
3. Click "Create Account"
4. Log in with your new credentials

All passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt, and user data is stored in a local SQLite database.
